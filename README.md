# Convert_img_into_text
MY PROJECT IS ON COMPUTER VISION BASED TEXT SCANNER BY USING PYTHON  AND THEIR LIBRARIES.

The project is on scanning and converting the document image into a text in form.
When the user give the doc image to my application then this program will convert that doc image into text form. So the user don not need to type that text they can simply use this program.

If you want to run this pyhton project u simply need some PYHTON Libraries
which are :
1. OpenCv :- OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. 

2. Pytesserect :- Pytesseract or Python- tesseract is an OCR toolkit built for Python. Python- tesseract acts as a wrapper for Google’s Tesseract-OCR Engine. However, it functions well as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract.
   
3. Pillow


If you want to Use another image 
put that image into same folder where source code is.
And write the image name to line 5 

And the project is ready to go.
